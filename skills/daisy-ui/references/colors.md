### daisyUI color rules
1. daisyUI adds semantic color names to Tailwind CSS colors
2. daisyUI color names can be used in utility classes, like other Tailwind CSS color names. for example, `bg-primary` will use the primary color for the background
3. daisyUI color names include variables as value so they can change based the theme
4. There's no need to use `dark:` for daisyUI color names
5. Ideally only daisyUI color names should be used for colors so the colors can change automatically based on the theme
6. If a Tailwind CSS color name (like `red-500`) is used, it will be same red color on all themes
7. If a daisyUI color name (like `primary`) is used, it will change color based on the theme
8. Using Tailwind CSS color names for text colors should be avoided because Tailwind CSS color `text-gray-800` on `bg-base-100` would be unreadable on a dark theme - because on dark theme, `bg-base-100` is a dark color
9. `*-content` colors should have a good contrast compared to their associated colors
10. suggestion - when designing a page use `base-*` colors for majority of the page. use `primary` color for important elements
