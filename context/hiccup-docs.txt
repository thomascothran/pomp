### Basic Hiccup Syntax Example

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/README.md

Demonstrates the basic syntax of Hiccup for generating HTML. It shows how to create a span element with a class attribute and text content using Hiccup's vector-based representation.

```Clojure
user=> (require '[hiccup2.core :as h])
nil
user=> (str (h/html [:span {:class "foo"} "bar"]))
"<span class=\"foo\">bar</span>"
```

--------------------------------

### Expanding Seq Contents into Element Body

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/README.md

Shows how Hiccup expands the contents of a seq into the element body. This example uses a for loop to generate a list of li elements within a ul element.

```Clojure
user=> (str (h/html [:ul
                     (for [x (range 1 4)]
                       [:li x])]))
"<ul><li>1</li><li>2</li><li>3</li></ul>"
```

--------------------------------

### CSS-like Shortcut for ID and Class

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/README.md

Demonstrates Hiccup's CSS-like shortcut for specifying id and class attributes. It shows how to create a div element with multiple classes and an id using a concise syntax.

```Clojure
user=> (str (h/html [:div#foo.bar.baz "bang"]))
"<div id=\"foo\" class=\"bar baz\">bang</div>"
```

--------------------------------

### Using Iteration with Seqs

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/doc/syntax.md

Demonstrates using a for loop to generate a sequence of list items within an unordered list. This shows how seqs can be used with iteration.

```Clojure
[:ul (for [i (range 3)] [:li i])]
```

--------------------------------

### Basic HTML Element Creation

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/doc/syntax.md

Creates a simple HTML span element using Hiccup's vector-based syntax. The keyword :span represents the HTML element.

```Clojure
[:span]
```

--------------------------------

### Rendering HTML Elements

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/README.md

Illustrates how Hiccup renders different HTML elements, accommodating browser quirks. It shows the difference in rendering self-closing tags like script and p.

```Clojure
user=> (str (h/html [:script]))
"<script></script>"
user=> (str (h/html [:p]))
"<p />"
```

--------------------------------

### Doctype Declaration with raw

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/README.md

Demonstrates how to use the hiccup2.core/raw function for doctype declarations. It shows how to include a doctype declaration and an html tag with a language attribute.

```Clojure
user=> (str (h/html (h/raw "<!DOCTYPE html>") [:html {:lang "en"}]))
"<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"></html>"
```

--------------------------------

### Add Hiccup dependency using deps.edn

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/README.md

Adds the Hiccup library as a dependency to a Clojure project using the deps.edn configuration file. This allows the project to use Hiccup's HTML generation capabilities.

```Clojure
hiccup/hiccup {:mvn/version "2.0.0-RC5"}
```

--------------------------------

### Add Hiccup dependency using Leiningen

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/README.md

Adds the Hiccup library as a dependency to a Clojure project using the Leiningen build tool. This allows the project to use Hiccup's HTML generation capabilities.

```Clojure
[hiccup "2.0.0-RC5"]
```

--------------------------------

### Rendering Text in HTML

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/doc/syntax.md

Renders plain text within a span element. Strings are automatically rendered as text content.

```Clojure
[:span "Hello world"]
```

--------------------------------

### Bypassing String Escaping with raw

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/README.md

Shows how to bypass automatic string escaping using the hiccup2.core/raw function. This is useful for including raw HTML in the output.

```Clojure
user=> (str (h/html [:p (h/raw "Hello <em>World</em>")]))
"<p>Hello <em>World</em></p>"
```

--------------------------------

### Automatic String Escaping

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/README.md

Demonstrates how Hiccup automatically escapes strings to prevent HTML injection. It shows how special characters like < and > are converted to their corresponding HTML entities.

```Clojure
user=> (str (h/html [:p "Tags in HTML are written with <>"]))
"<p>Tags in HTML are written with &lt;&gt;</p>"
```

--------------------------------

### Hiccup 2 String Escaping

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/README.md

Shows how strings are automatically escaped in Hiccup 2. The return value from the html macro is a RawString, ensuring that the macro can still be nested.

```Clojure
(str (h2/html [:div "Username: " username]))
```

--------------------------------

### Hiccup 1 String Escaping

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/README.md

Illustrates how to escape strings in Hiccup 1 using the h function. This ensures that unsafe characters are converted into their equivalent entity codes.

```Clojure
(h1/html [:div "Username: " (h1/h username)])
```

--------------------------------

### Combining ID and Class Selectors

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/doc/syntax.md

Combines the # and . characters to specify both the id and class attributes of a span element. This demonstrates how to set both attributes concisely.

```Clojure
[:span#foo.bar.baz "Hello world"]
```

--------------------------------

### Nested HTML Elements

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/doc/syntax.md

Demonstrates nesting HTML elements within a div element.  Multiple span elements are nested within the div.

```Clojure
[:div [:span] [:span]]
```

--------------------------------

### Specifying Class with CSS Selectors

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/doc/syntax.md

Specifies the class attribute of a span element using the . character. This is a concise way to set the class.

```Clojure
[:span.foo "Hello world"]
```

--------------------------------

### Converting Objects to Strings

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/doc/syntax.md

Converts a number to a string within a span element. Values of types that have no special meaning are converted into strings before being rendered.

```Clojure
[:span 42]
```

--------------------------------

### Adding Attributes to HTML Elements

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/doc/syntax.md

Adds a class attribute to a span element. A map is used to specify the attributes, with keywords as keys and strings as values.

```Clojure
[:span {:class "foo"} "Hello world"]
```

--------------------------------

### Expanding Seqs

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/doc/syntax.md

Expands a seq (list) into individual elements within a span element. Seqs are automatically expanded out.

```Clojure
[:span '("foo" "bar")]
```

--------------------------------

### Specifying ID with CSS Selectors

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/doc/syntax.md

Specifies the id attribute of a span element using the # character. This is a concise way to set the id.

```Clojure
[:span#foo "Hello world"]
```

--------------------------------

### Concatenating Adjacent Strings

Source: https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/blob/master/doc/syntax.md
